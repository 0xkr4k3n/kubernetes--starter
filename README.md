# k8s-starter
A URL shortener application designed as a series of microservices, deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. This project is a continuous learning journey, growing in complexity with v2 to introduce scalability, additional microservices, and event-driven architecture.


# Features

Kubernetes Deployment: Services managed as pods with NodePort and ClusterIP configurations.

Ingress Configuration: External access to backend services using ingress rules.

Prometheus Integration (Init): Metrics collection for monitoring.
